# My Preferred VIM Text Editor Layout

### Overview 

This is a simple configuration file for setting up a .vimrc setup file. The usefulness 
is that instead of consistently needing to change my .vimrc manually I can pull this config
via [this repository](https://github.com/julianjones95/vimrc). Feel free to use this repo.

### Setup

To set this up all you need is to copy the text from .vimrc into your .vimrc file. Commands 
for this are as follows:

	1. Run the command `vim ~/.vimrc ` 
    2. Take the contents from here: [.vimrc](https://github.com/julianjones95/vimrc/blob/master/.vimrc) 
	3. Paste them into the file and close the file (:wq)
	4. Observe the changes inside vim
