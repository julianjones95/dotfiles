# My Development Environment

### Justification 

Creating an optimized development is important. When switching to a new machine it can be difficult or tedious 
to have to re-download and setup everything. This is a handy configuration which allows automation of dotfiles.
This is useful as when I get a new machine I am going to be doing work from I am not slowed by the lack of tooling
needed for an optimal dev env.

### Setup

Once this directory is cloned from github you will need to run the `createLinks.sh` script. This
will create symbolic links to all of the config files and avoids mess of actually going into the private dot files. I 
found this idea [here](https://superuser.com/questions/152574/keeping-my-zsh-or-bash-profile-synced-up-on-all-my-machines#answer-152600). 

Commands:

    1. `chmod 777 createSymLinks.sh`
    2. `./createLinks.sh`

## Text Editor Setup (NVIM)

#### Justification 

I prefer to use neovim as my text editor. The usefulness of having some of the neovim plugins allow extra speed 
and shortcuts during development. Syntax highlighting inside NVIM as well as auto suggestion are useful and 
allow me to continually get faster using vim.

#### Setup

1. Download NVIM
2. download telescope 


## Commandline Shell (ZSH)

#### Justification 

#### Setup

1. Download NVIM

## Windows Manager (TMUX)

#### Justification 

Tmux is a staple in my workflow. The necessity to have multiple terminals running software can be hard to manage. 
Using Tmux makes managing this in one window fast and simple. I often split my windows into 4 usually with nvim and 
terminals for compilation.

#### Setup

1. Download TMUX
2. download telescope 


## Terminal Emulator (iTerm2)

#### Justification 

iTerm2 is useful as this allows great formatting. As well as a useful history of syntax completion and many other useful features.

#### Setup

1. Download NVIM
